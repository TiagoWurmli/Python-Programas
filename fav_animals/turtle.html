            <p class="fist-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to talk about my favorite turtle species, Trachemys dorbigni, in Brazil it's called tiger-turtle, and in English it's known as D'Orbigny's slider. It can be found in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. It is omnivorous because it is an aquatic turtle, its diet consists mainly of vegetables, but they also need animal protein, so they hunt crabs, sponges and small fish and insects. It lives mainly in swamps, marshes, lakes, streams and rivers.</p>

        <p class="second-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Females lay, on average, more than 10 eggs per clutch. The eggs hatch between 2 to 4 months. A curious fact is that the sex of turtles is determined by the temperature of the nest during incubation: the lower the temperature, the greater the chance of being born male, and the higher the temperature, the greater the chance of being born a female. When they come out of their eggs, they measure an average of 3 cm, and reach a size of 25 to 30 cm in length in the adult stage, the females are generally larger than the males. Tiger tortoises live up to 30 years of age.</p>

            <p class="third-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, dear reader, and welcome! I'm Tiago Ismael Wurmli, a Brazilian college student in the IT field, and because of some experiences I had in my childhood, these became my favorite animals, which I've always had a fascination with and a greater appreciation for than others. The purpose of this blog is for me to share with you, dear reader, the reasons why I love tortoises, anteaters and toucans so much. Explain why they are my favorite animals, how they became special to me, and a little bit of the characteristics of each one. Some were due to events that I had in my life. Also because they have a very peculiar appearance, and something very characteristic that calls a lot of attention. There is the possibility that when you, dear reader, read my reasons and more about each one of them, you can relate to the same feelings, or be inspired to know better about your own tastes through the reflection generated by the path to be taken in this blog.</p>
