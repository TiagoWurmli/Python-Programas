            <h2>General Information and Facts</h2>
            <img src="images/toucan-berry.jpg" class="image" alt="Turtle and a bubble">
            <p class="toucan-first-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the toucans, my favorite is the Toco Toucan, the largest (and most beautiful) of the toucans. They are mainly found in Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. It is about 63 cm long and weighs around 680 g. The toucan has 4 fingers, two forward and two backwards, to make it easier to stay in trees. The large beak, which is what most attracts attention, measures approximately half of the rest of the body, and as much as it may seem, this beak is very light because it is soft inside, which makes it not strong, facilitates the flight, and serves to dissipate heat. The toucan has several vertebrae in the tail, more than other birds, making it possible to turn the tail forward until it touches the head, and they use it to cover themselves when they go to sleep.</p>
            <p class="toucan-second-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toucans feed mainly on fruits, as they have a very short digestive system, which means that they cannot eat things that are difficult to digest. There is no visible difference between males and females, and they are a monogamous species (meaning they only have one sexual partner for life, how cute!). Its reproduction occurs in late spring and the female lays 4 to 6 eggs in nests in trees. Both the male and the female play the role of hatching the eggs, which hatch between 16 and 20 days. They are born ugly as it hurts, with a tiny body and a giant beak. The eyes only open after three weeks and the parents take care of them until they leave the nests, around six weeks.</p>

            <p class="toucan-third-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, dear reader, and welcome! I'm Tiago Ismael Wurmli, a Brazilian college student in the IT field, and because of some experiences I had in my childhood, these became my favorite animals, which I've always had a fascination with and a greater appreciation for than others. The purpose of this blog is for me to share with you, dear reader, the reasons why I love tortoises, anteaters and toucans so much. Explain why they are my favorite animals, how they became special to me, and a little bit of the characteristics of each one. Some were due to events that I had in my life. Also because they have a very peculiar appearance, and something very characteristic that calls a lot of attention. There is the possibility that when you, dear reader, read my reasons and more about each one of them, you can relate to the same feelings, or be inspired to know better about your own tastes through the reflection generated by the path to be taken in this blog.</p>
