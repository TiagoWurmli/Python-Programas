            <p class="toucan-first-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite anteater is the giant anteater, which in Brazil is called flag anteater because of the shape of its tail. It is about 2 meters long and this animal's diet consists of, guess what, ants! (and also termites). They can live up to 25 years. It is found in much of South and Central America, especially here in Brazil. It lives in forests and savannas. For shelter, it prefers forests and more closed and humid places, but it looks for food in open areas. They are solitary animals and only meet for reproduction.</p>
            <p class="toucan-second-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it feeds only on ants and termites, the tamandua does not have teeth, they use their large claws to dig in the anthills, climb trees and even swim in rivers. From its long, thin snout comes a large, sticky tongue about 60 cm long that sticks ants to it. The ants are then crushed and crushed by their stomach walls. The tamandua still eats a little bit of sand and uses the ants' own acid to help with digestion, since it does not produce its own acid. (it's a pretty peculiar animal huh!)</p>

            <p class="toucan-third-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, dear reader, and welcome! I'm Tiago Ismael Wurmli, a Brazilian college student in the IT field, and because of some experiences I had in my childhood, these became my favorite animals, which I've always had a fascination with and a greater appreciation for than others. The purpose of this blog is for me to share with you, dear reader, the reasons why I love tortoises, anteaters and toucans so much. Explain why they are my favorite animals, how they became special to me, and a little bit of the characteristics of each one. Some were due to events that I had in my life. Also because they have a very peculiar appearance, and something very characteristic that calls a lot of attention. There is the possibility that when you, dear reader, read my reasons and more about each one of them, you can relate to the same feelings, or be inspired to know better about your own tastes through the reflection generated by the path to be taken in this blog.</p>
