    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to share information and opinions for
        people who want to practice rowing. As a level of difficulty, places to
        practice, costs in general, accommodation, place to park, necessary
        equipment, teaching both for beginners, as for the more advanced and
        everything else we can provide. All for the greatest possible ease to
        avoid unnecessary stress and encourage the practice of this wonderful
        sport. We count on the help of the community to provide their sincere
        comments, photos of the place and even more information, thus keeping
        everything updated and complete with the evaluations of the users
        themselves.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience of this site are people who want to start and learn
        rowing, also those who already practice this sport who would like new
        adventures, new challenges and to help the rowing community to grow. We
        hope that users are between 18 - 60. However, all help is welcome from
        those who have retired from the sport but have experience and
        information to contribute. Most of them will already live close to a
        rowing place or where they have the culture of pursuing this sport. The
        people in general who enter the site have a good financial condition,
        accessing the site both by laptop and mobile devices.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
