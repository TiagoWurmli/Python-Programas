        <p>Hello, my name is Tiago Ismael, but everyone where I live calls me Tiaguinho. I am studying for applied technology and I want to work in the IT field. I only study at the moment and live with my parents and my brother.</p>
        <p>I would love to learn more about the logic behind creating and designing sites, and being able to do this on my own.</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ since my birth. My favorite scripture is found in 2 Nephi 2:2. That talks about how difficulties are for our good and our own growth.</p>
